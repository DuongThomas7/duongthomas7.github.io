                        represent this fraternity. We shall advocate the growth and respectability 
                        of each member. Our goals are to demonstrate high performance in the classroom 
                        and increased involvement in campus, community, and nation. We strive for the 
                        values of Truth, Leadership, and Brotherhood, as well as acknowledge cultural 
                        awareness within the Asian American community. The skills we acquire will be vital 
                        for our experiences beyond the years of higher learning. Respect is among our 
                        greatest values; therefore any resolutions and judgments shall not take religion,

                    <h3>Fraternity History</h3>
                    <p>In the year 2010, 11 great men sought out an opportunity to establish an everlasting brotherhood. 
                        The vision of this organization teaches the values of truth, leadership, and most of all brotherhood. 
                        They felt the need in forming an Asian-American Awareness organization as well as spread Asian-American 
                        knowledge in themselves and to the community. From this combined vision, these men came forth and created 
                        Theta Lambda Beta Fraternity Incorporated at the University of Illinois at Chicago on September 20th, 2010.</p>

                    <h3>FAQ</h3>

                    <h3>What Are Our Three Main Pillars?</h3>
                    <p>Truth, Leadership and Brotherhood. 
                        Every brother of our fraternity upholds these three main values in an 
                        effort to better serve our community and improve ourselves</p>

                    <h3>What is our Philanthropy?</h3>
                    <p>Our philanthropy is Lupus. Lupus is a rare auto-immune disease in which the body's 
                        immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. One of our founders had lupus, and we 
                        hope to spread awareness about this disease to our community</p>

                    <h3>What do we do besides community service and Philanthropy events?</h3>
                    <p>We also step and stroll. Stepping and Strolling is derived from the Divine 9 organizations, 
                        from which all other fraternal cultural orgs build upon. We also host brotherhood and alumni events</p>

                    <h3>How do we get Theta Lambda Beta to join our college campus?</h3>
                    <p>You can email us @thlb.uic.president@gmail.com and our E-Board and 
                        National Board can discuss more information</p>
